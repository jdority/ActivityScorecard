# ActivityScorecard
Once Installed you can drag onto any lightning page. In app builder there are a set of configurable options to set this up to work for whatever you are demoing, the defaults are meant to work for a standard sales/inside sales user but you could change this to work for a Support Agent or really any other role.

A couple of configuration notes:

You can switch the KPIs between positive and negative via the “KPI 1 Positive?” and “KPI 2 Positive?” check boxes, all this does is toggle the number color.
You can change the Icons and progress bar color for each activity type. To change the icon simply pick the icon you would like to use here: https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/icons/ and use the “iconcategory:name” naming convention i.e. standard:case or custom:custom63. To change the progress bar color just enter whatever hex code you want.
When the number of activities completed is greater than the personal best the bottom text will change to “New Personal Best” and become bold.
